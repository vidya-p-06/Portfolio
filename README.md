# Portfolio
This Portfolio Website is a personal project showcasing my skills, projects, experience, and achievements as a Java Full Stack Developer. It includes sections like Home, About Me, Projects, Experience, and Contact to highlight my technical expertise, leadership roles (NCC CQMS, Best Cadet), internship at Cyber Sanskar, and volunteer work (Save Soil, NCC River Cleaning).
The site is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with optional technologies like React, Java (Spring Boot), and PostgreSQL if backend functionality is included. It features a responsive design, smooth animations, and interactive elements.
Visitors can explore my major & minor projects with descriptions and links, view my professional journey, and contact me through social media links or a contact form.
The project is open-source, hosted on GitHub, and deployed using GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel.
